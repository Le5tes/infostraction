# Infostraction

## Aim

To create an application that can answer user generated questions by searching a corpus of documents for the answer.

A lot of the work will be done by python nlp libraries such as nltk and spacy

## Structure

### Find documents

First the application will perform a search of the corpus to return the most relevant documents and order the documents by relevance.

### Perform information extraction

Then the application will attempt to parse the query, as well as segments (probably sentences) in the documents, to produce a structured data format that can be queried.

### Store answers for later use?

Perhaps the application will store the answers in a structured way so that later queries can be faster.
